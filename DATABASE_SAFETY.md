### Database Safety: Avoiding Data Corruption via Migrations

**Problem Scenario**:  
Database corruption can occur during migrations if not handled properly. This can lead to data loss and application failures, impacting user experience and trust.

**Why Learn This**:  
Understanding the principles of database migrations is crucial for developers. It ensures that data integrity is maintained and that applications can evolve without losing critical information.

**Mini Project Steps**:  
1. Set up a sample Ruby on Rails application with a database.  
2. Create a migration that adds a new column to an existing table.  
3. Implement data validation to prevent corrupt data entries during the migration.  
4. Roll back the migration and observe the behavior of the application.  
5. Test the application thoroughly after the migration.

**Success Tips**:  
- Always backup your database before performing migrations.  
- Use version control for migration files.  
- Review migration scripts for potential pitfalls before running them.  
- Test migrations in a staging environment prior to production.

**Success Metric**:  
Success will be measured by the ability to run the migration without errors, the integrity of the data before and after the migration, and the applicationâ€™s performance post-migration.
