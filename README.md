# Ruby/Rails 2-Week Learning Roadmap

This roadmap is designed to guide you through a comprehensive 2-week learning journey in Ruby on Rails, focusing on hands-on projects that solidify your understanding of essential concepts. Each day will cover a specific topic with problem scenarios, mini projects, and success metrics.

## Week 1: Foundations

### Day 1: Database Safety
- **Problem Scenario:** You need to ensure that user data is stored securely and that the database is protected from SQL injection attacks.
- **Mini Project:** Create a simple Rails application that implements user authentication and validates user inputs to prevent SQL injection.
- **Success Metrics:** 
  - Application passes all security tests.
  - No SQL injection vulnerabilities found.

### Day 2: Data Flow Tracing
- **Problem Scenario:** Understanding how data flows through your application can help debug and optimize performance.
- **Mini Project:** Build a Rails application that tracks and logs all data interactions in a user-friendly way.
- **Success Metrics:**
  - Successfully logs data flow events.
  - Performance improved by optimizing identified bottlenecks.

### Day 3: Authentication & Authorization
- **Problem Scenario:** Users need to securely log in and access their personal data while preventing unauthorized access.
- **Mini Project:** Implement a user authentication system with role-based access control in your Rails app.
- **Success Metrics:**
  - Users can register, log in, and log out.
  - Access control works as expected based on user roles.

## Week 2: Advanced Topics

### Day 4: API Integration
- **Problem Scenario:** Your application needs to connect with external services for data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Mini Project:** Create a Rails API that interacts with a third-party service (e.g., fetching weather data).
- **Success Metrics:**
  - Successfully integrates with the third-party API.
  - Data is displayed correctly in the application.

### Day 5: CI/CD & Testing
- **Problem Scenario:** Ensuring that your application is continuously tested and deployed can prevent bugs from reaching production.
- **Mini Project:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline for your Rails application that includes automated testing and deployment.
- **Success Metrics:**
  - All tests pass successfully in the CI environment.
  - Application is automatically deployed to a staging environment.

## Conclusion
Congratulations on completing the 2-week Ruby/Rails learning roadmap! Keep practicing and expanding your skills by exploring more advanced topics and contributing to open-source projects.
